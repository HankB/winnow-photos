# winnow-photos

Provide assistance to remove unnecessary photos.

## Current Photo processing flow.

At present I use a script to import photos from any location to `~/Pictures/YYYY/MM/DD/` based on image tags or file date. When I want to provide an album of sorts, I copy the photos from this receiving directory to `~/Pictures/YYYY/YYYY-MM-DD_sume-useful-description/` and possibly edit. (This used to be `~/Pictures/YYYY-MM-DD_sume-useful-description/` but the `~/Pictures/` directory was getting too crowded. )
